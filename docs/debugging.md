# Debugging Guide

## How can I confirm if all Docker containers are running as expected after a quickstart?

If you set up the `datahub` CLI tool (see [here](../metadata-ingestion/README.md)), you can use the built-in check utility:
```shell
datahub docker check
```

You can list all Docker containers in your local by running `docker container ls`. You should expect to see a log similar to the below:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                 COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                      NAMES

ce14b9758eb3        mysql:5.7
```

Also you can check individual Docker container logs by running `docker logs <<container_name>>`. For `datahub-gms`, you should see a log similar to this at the end of the initialization:
```
2020-02-06 09:20:54.870:INFO:oejs.Server:main: Started @18807ms
```

For `datahub-frontend-react`, you should see a log similar to this at the end of the initialization:
```
09:20:22 [main] INFO  play.core.server.AkkaHttpServer - Listening for HTTP on /0.0.0.0:9002
```

## My elasticsearch or broker container exited with error or was stuck forever

If you're seeing errors like below, chances are you didn't give enough resource to docker. Please make sure to allocate at least 8GB of RAM + 2GB swap space.
```

## How can I check if [MXE](what/mxe.md) Kafka topics are created?

You can use a utility like [kafkacat](https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat) to list all topics.
You can run below command to see the Kafka topics created in your Kafka broker.

```bash
kafkacat -L -b localhost:9092
```

Confirm that `MetadataChangeEvent` & `MetadataAuditEvent` topics exist besides the default ones. Example response as below:

```bash
Metadata for all topics (from broker 1: localhost:9092/1):
 1 brokers:
  broker 1 at localhost:9092

  topic "_schemas" with 1 partitions:

## How can I check if search indices are created in Elasticsearch?

You can run below command to see the search indices created in your Elasticsearch.

```bash
curl http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices
```

Confirm that `datasetdocument` & `corpuserinfodocument` indices exist besides the default ones. Example response as below:

```bash
yellow open .monitoring-es-6-2020.01.27     hNu-jjU3Tl2SKKFdXzjxHQ 1 1 27279 34  14.8mb  14.8mb

## How can I check if data has been loaded into MySQL properly?

Once the mysql container is up and running, you should be able to connect to it dirctly on `localhost:3306` using tools such as [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/). You can also run the following command to invoke [MySQL Command-Line Client](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql.html) inside the mysql container.

```
docker exec -it mysql /usr/bin/mysql datahub --user=datahub --password=datahub
```

Inspect the content of `metadata_aspect` table, which contains the ingested aspects for all entities.

## Getting error while starting Docker containers
There can be different reasons why a container fails during initialization. Below are the most common reasons:

### `bind: address already in use`
This error means that the network port (which is supposed to be used by the failed container) is already in use on your system. You need to find and kill the process which is using this specific port before starting the corresponding Docker container. If you don't want to kill the process which is using that port, another option is to change the port number for the Docker container. You need to find and change the [ports](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#ports) parameter for the specific Docker container in the `docker-compose.yml` configuration file.

```
Example : On macOS

ERROR: for mysql  Cannot start service mysql: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint mysql (5abc99513affe527299514cea433503c6ead9e2423eeb09f127f87e2045db2ca): Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:3306: bind: address already in use

   1) sudo lsof -i :3306
   2) kill -15 <PID found in step1>
```
### `OCI runtime create failed`
If you see an error message like below, please make sure to git update your local repo to HEAD.
```
ERROR: for datahub-mae-consumer  Cannot start service datahub-mae-consumer: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:349: starting container process caused "exec: \"bash\": executable file not found in $PATH": unknown
```

### `failed to register layer: devmapper: Unknown device`
This most means that you're out of disk space (see [#1879](https://github.com/linkedin/datahub/issues/1879)).

### `ERROR: for kafka-rest-proxy  Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/confluentinc/cp-kafka-rest/manifests/5.4.0: EOF`
This is most likely a transient issue with [Docker Registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/). Retry again later.

## toomanyrequests: too many failed login attempts for username or IP address
Try the following
```bash
rm ~/.docker/config.json
docker login
```
More discussions on the same issue https://github.com/docker/hub-feedback/issues/1250

## Seeing `Table 'datahub.metadata_aspect' doesn't exist` error when logging in
This means the database wasn't properly initialized as part of the quickstart processs (see [#1816](https://github.com/linkedin/datahub/issues/1816)). Please run the following command to manually initialize it.
```
docker exec -i mysql sh -c 'exec mysql datahub -udatahub -pdatahub' < docker/mysql/init.sql
```

## I've messed up my docker setup. How do I start from scratch?
Run the following script to remove all the containers and volumes created during the quickstart tutorial. Note that you'll also lose all the data as a result.
```
./docker/nuke.sh
```
